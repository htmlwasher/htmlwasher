"""Locate the bundled Node runtime and the shipped JS CLI.

Python never loads the napi ``.node`` — Node does, when it runs ``cli.js``. This
module only resolves filesystem paths:

* ``resolve_node`` — the Node binary from the ``nodejs-wheel-binaries`` dependency
  (or a ``TRAFILATURACORE_NODE_PATH`` override).
* ``vendor_cli_dir`` — materializes the flattened CLI tree staged under
  ``_vendor/cli`` (see ``scripts/stage_vendor.py``) as a real directory via
  ``importlib.resources.as_file`` (a no-op on disk; extracts + cleans up from a zip).
* ``cli_js`` — the ``dist/cli.js`` entry point inside that materialized tree.

In-repo/dev usage points ``vendor_cli_dir`` at the sibling engine package (which
already carries a built ``dist/cli.js`` + a real ``node_modules``); the installed
wheel vendors an equivalent tree under ``_vendor/cli``. Both resolve the same
``<cli_dir>/dist/cli.js`` shape.
